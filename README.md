The hybrid cipher presented in this report integrates AES encryption with a Rail Fence transposition technique, creating a secure and efficient encryption system. This combination leverages both confusion and diffusion principles to enhance resistance against cryptanalysis.

3.1 Cipher Design Process
To achieve robust encryption, the hybrid cipher employs:
1. AES Encryption Layer: The plaintext undergoes AES encryption with a 128-bit key to introduce strong substitution.
2. Rail Fence Transposition Layer: The AES-encrypted text is rearranged using a Rail Fence transposition cipher to introduce diffusion.
Steps:
1. Convert plaintext into numerical blocks.
2. Encrypt each block using AES with a secret key.
3. Rearrange the AES ciphertext using a Rail Fence transposition scheme for further obfuscation.
   
3.2 Encryption and Decryption Examples
Example:
• Plaintext: "HELLOHYBRIDENCRYPTION"
• AES Key: 128-bit secret key.
• Transposition Key: Rail Fence pattern with three rails.
Encryption:
1. Convert plaintext into bytes.
2. Apply AES encryption to produce ciphertext.
3. Rearrange the encrypted text using a Rail Fence transposition method.
Decryption:
1. Reverse the transposition step.
2. Apply AES decryption to obtain the original plaintext.
   
3.3 Security Evaluation
The hybrid cipher enhances security by combining substitution (AES) with diffusion (Rail Fence transposition), making it resilient to cryptanalysis.
Justification:
• AES Encryption: Prevents frequency analysis by transforming plaintext into non-discernible ciphertext.
• Rail Fence Transposition: Obscures ciphertext patterns by redistributing characters across multiple lines.
• Hybrid Strength: Even if one layer is partially compromised, the other layer maintains security.

3.4 Mathematical Formulation
Let P be the plaintext, K_AES be the AES key, and K_RF be the Rail Fence key:
1. AES Encryption: C1 = AES_Encrypt(P, K_AES)
2. Rail Fence Transposition: C2 = RailFence_Encrypt(C1, K_RF)
For decryption:
1. Reverse Rail Fence Transposition: C1 = RailFence_Decrypt(C2, K_RF)
2. AES Decryption: P = AES_Decrypt(C1, K_AES)
   
3.5 Why is the Hybrid Approach More Secure?
1. Confusion (AES Substitution):
o Strong non-linearity makes it resistant to brute-force attacks.
o Eliminates plaintext-ciphertext correspondence.
2. Diffusion (Rail Fence Transposition):
o Disrupts ciphertext structure, making statistical attacks ineffective.
3. Layered Security:
o Even if the transposition key is compromised, AES encryption ensures security.

3.6 Security Justification
The hybrid cipher achieves high security through:
• Resistance to Frequency Analysis: AES transforms plaintext structure, and transposition further masks patterns.
• Computational Complexity: Requires brute-force attempts on both AES and transposition layers.
• Scalability: Supports varying block sizes and additional encryption layers for enhanced security.
